//! Fixed, bounded provider requests and one-shot input commitment.

//! Request construction accepts only a token-admitted objective and an
//! existing semantic observation/read or bound tool-result payload, plus an
//! optional closed policy-derived navigation checkpoint. The provider body is generated
//! from an immutable instruction and the same closed tool vocabulary decoded
//! locally. It has no arbitrary instructions, provider-native browser tools,
//! selectors, JavaScript, DOM/HTML, prior-response state, or secrets. Normal
//! requests carry no metadata; release-excluded retained public-page probes
//! may carry only fixed non-user metadata labels.
