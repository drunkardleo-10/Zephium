//! Small, fail-closed filesystem primitives for browser-owned private data.
//!
//! This crate owns the platform-specific boundary checks shared by durable
//! browser subsystems. It deliberately does not own any subsystem's journal,
//! recovery, garbage-collection, or package-admission policy.
//!
//! Phase-one namespace activation is available only on macOS and Linux, where
//! child operations are descriptor-relative. Linux additionally requires a
//! readable `/proc/self/fd` so exact spelling can be proven from live file
//! descriptors even on case-folding filesystems. Missing or restricted procfs
//! fails closed. Other Unix targets and Windows fail closed until their native
//! adapters have passed dedicated live tests. Windows has an explicit
//! `windows-namespace-validation` feature for debug validation on local NTFS;
//! it is disabled by default and forbidden in optimized shipping builds.
//!
//! The boundary excludes unprivileged operating-system principals that have no
//! delegated access and rejects untrusted package contents. Root/administrator,
//! malicious code already running with the same user authority, and mutation
//! rights delegated through an accepted ancestor ACL are outside the guarantee;
//! the lease lock only serializes cooperating Zephium processes. Exact identity
//! checks detect observed path redirection and stickily quarantine the lease.
