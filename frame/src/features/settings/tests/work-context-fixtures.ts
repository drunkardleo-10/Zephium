# Weekly review

## First
- Read my notes from this week (search_notes "week") and my open tabs.

## Result
- A plan for next week: three priorities, then the days.
- Keep it short; no document unless I ask.

# Trip planning

## First
- Know the dates (or length and month), where from, who travels and the budget.
- A known event fixes the dates and the place.

## Parts (start them in one turn, they run in parallel)
- **Stay**: browser part on airbnb.com. It returns three homes as picks.
- **Flights**: browser part on google.com/travel/flights.
- **Entry**: research part: visa or ESTA, passport validity.

## Result
- One **plan** from the flight out to the flight back, with a total.
